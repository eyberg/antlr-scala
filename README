ABOUT:

  this will contain as I get the time an antlr target
  for scala -- it really should not be that hard because
  we can essentially use the vast majority of the java
  stuff to generate our scala classes...

  just expanded the included antlr jar to make this
  -- we prob. don't need all this extra crap laying
  around...

  following this:
    http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/How+to+build+an+ANTLR+code+generation+target


WHY:

  I've been converting a java project to scala to learn
scala recently and started to not like muddying up
my grammars with code that looked like this:

  hand.actions().\$eq\$plus(naction);

when in scala it could look like this:

  hand.actions += naction

HOW:

  thinking the key here is to make quite a few tests
  and then start having them go from red to green

  javap is your best buddy and friend -- if scala
  or java starts to bitch about something not being
  availale import the (java/scala) class and then use
  javap on it to figure out which method you need
  to substitue it with

  anyways.... to get started all you need to do
  is cd into scala-target/

  from there you can:

  java -cp ~/antlr-scala/ org.antlr.Tool T.g

  to generate your test grammar

WHEN:
  hopefully I don't go get drunk and blow this
  off for a month
